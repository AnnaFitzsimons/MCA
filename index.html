	  <p style = "font-size:100%;">Current manifestations of this dataset theme include a "Broadway" Genre on Spotify. This contains playlists such as:</p>
	  <ul>
	       <li>Best of Broadway</li>
		   <li>Sucessos da Broadway</li>
		   <li>Hits from Musicals</li>
		   <li>Ballads from Musicals</li>
		   
		</ul>
			<p style = "font-size:100%;">The app also possesses several unofficial playlists made by spotify users</p><br>
			<b><p style = "font-size:120%;">How is the data presented, described and analysed?</p></b>
			<p>The data is presented in a series of playlists, each accompanied by a cover photo as well as the number of followers the playlist has.
			Compared to other genres "Broadway" has significantly less content within it, suggesting a lack of demand.
			Each song that exists within the playlist comes with 'Song Credits' which includes who the song is 'Performed by'; 'Written by'; 'Produced by';
			as well as the 'Source' of the music. <br>
			Spotify presumably produces these genre playlists by analysing each song's accompanying metadata.</p><br>
