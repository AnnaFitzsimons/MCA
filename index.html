	  <h2>Project Dataset: Musical Theater</h2>
	  
	  <p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 1: Musical Datasets</b></p>
	  <p style = "font-size:100%;">Current manifestations of this dataset theme include a "Broadway" Genre on Spotify. This contains playlists such as:</p>
	  <ul>
	       <li>Best of Broadway</li>
		   <li>Sucessos da Broadway</li>
		   <li>Hits from Musicals</li>
		   <li>Ballads from Musicals</li>
		   
		</ul>
			<p style = "font-size:100%;">The app also possesses several unofficial playlists made by spotify users</p><br>
			<b><p style = "font-size:120%;">How is the data presented, described and analysed?</p></b>
			<p>The data is presented in a series of playlists, each accompanied by a cover photo as well as the number of followers the playlist has.
			Compared to other genres "Broadway" has significantly less content within it, suggesting a lack of demand.
			Each song that exists within the playlist comes with 'Song Credits' which includes who the song is 'Performed by'; 'Written by'; 'Produced by';
			as well as the 'Source' of the music. <br>
			Spotify presumably produces these genre playlists by analysing each song's accompanying metadata.</p><br>

	<ul>
		
		<li><a href="DROMP1.html">Don't Rain On My Parade (Original Version)</a></li>
		<li><a href="DROMP_GLEE.html">Don't Rain On My Parade (Glee Cast Version) </a></li>

		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 3: Encoding Notated Music</b></p>
		<p>In week 3, we transformed our MusicXML files into MEI so they could be viewed on the site 'Verovio'. Through the use 
		of  Oxygen we were able to explore each of our MEI files and observe changes in the notated music after the modification of the MEI file.
		In my exploration I changed the octave from a 1 to a 3 and played around with several pitch names. The most obvious change however,
		came after I changed the duration from a 4 to a 3, this resulted in one of the notes being deleted entirely and consequently altered the entire introduction of the piece.
		These changes can be observed in the images below:</p>

		<img src="/MCA/data/Lab_3/DRUMPeditedMEI.png" alt="Edited MEI file presented through Verovio" width="600" height="500"></br>
		<p>The rest of the information and files such as musicxml and mei can be accessed and viewed through data/Lab_3</p>
		
		
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 5: Basic Analytics</b></p>
		<p>In order to complete Week 5 we were instructed to generate a JSymbolic of our pieces and select a group of features we deemed relevant to each.
		The CSV file that was generated during this tasks can be found here:</p><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_5_Analysis/DRUMP.csv">CSV File in Excel</a><br>
		<p>We were then instructed to generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of our pieces, these can be seen below:</p><br>

		<br>
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 7: Basic Analytics</b></p>
		<p>In Week 7 I added metadata to both Don't Rain on My Parade files, providing information regarding each piece such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Work Creator e.g. Composer</li>
			<li>Work Lyricist</li>
			<li>Work Performer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to the files being two different versions of the same piece, the only notable difference in the metadata between the two
			was the performer and its origin, notated by the Series Stmt tag. These edited MEI files can be found here:</p><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_7/Don't rain on my parade.mei">DRUMP MEI</a><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_7/Don't Rain On My Parade Glee.mei">DRUMP GLEE MEI</a> <br><br>

		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 8: Music as Sound</b></p>
		<p>For Week 8 we downloaded three music tracks of different genres from <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a></p>
		<p>Following this I constructed a table within Excel to showcase the different metadata associate with each track.
		   I later changed copied this table into a word document which contains Waveforms and Spectogram images for each track: <a href="/MCA/data/Lab_8/Metadata Table.docx">Metadata Document</a></p>
		<p><b>Time Frequency V Waveform Analysis:</b> In evaluation of the difference between Time Frequency analysis and Waveform it could argued that Time Frequency has a certain advantage over waveform due to its simplicity.
		Time frequency analysis can be read far easier than that of waveform which can often be impossible to decipher any information from. With reference to the the spectograms and waveforms included in the document above,
		in the comparrison of the spectograms of 'Grass is not a flower' and 'Positive and Fun' it could be argued that is for more easier to draw information from them. For example, in looking at the end of both pieces of audio
		we can see that 'Positive and Fun' comes to a conclusion at a much higher amplitude than that on 'Grass is not a flower', this can be determined through the darkness or brightness of the waves.
		Therefore due to the more simplistic nature of Time Frequency analysis it could be argued that we are able to gain greater detail than we would be permitted through that of waveform.</p>
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 9: Extracting Meaning from Audio</b></p>
		<p>Week 9 again involved downloading three different music tracks and viewing them in SonicVisualiser.
		From this I extracted the Spectogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Chromagrams for the three tracks, these can be viewed here: <a href="I:/MCA/data/Lab_9/Lab 9.docx">Screenshots</a><br>
		I then loaded the the three CSV files into Python and computed Histograms for each feature. The table below displays the individual chroma histograms for the three tracks:</p>
		
		<table style="border: 1px solid black; width:100%;padding: 8px 10px">
			<tr>
				<th>All Things Magical</th>	
				<th>Don't Rain on My Parade</th>
				<th>Delight</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><img src="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Allthingsmagical_chromagram.png" alt="Chroma Histogram for All Things Magical" width="500" height="500"></th>
			    <th><img src="/MCA/data/Lab_9/dontrain_chromagram.png" alt="Chroma Histogram for Don't Rain on My Parade" width="500" height="500"></th>
				<th><img src="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Delight_chromagram.png" alt="Chroma Histogram for Delight" width="500" height="500"></th>
			</tr> 
			</table><br>
			
			<p><b>HISTOGRAM COMPARRISON:</b> Regarding the patterns of the histograms, each one appears to be skewed to the right, otherwise known as being a positive skew. In examination of feature 0, the histograms have varying levels
			of height, with 'Don't Rain on my Parade being significantly higher than the histogram of 'All Things Magical', and 'Delight' falling in between the two.
			Whilst it may be evident that the separate histograms each belong to different tracks, without further context it is difficult to distinguish which histogram accompanies which track. </p>
			<p>Raw CSV files:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Allthingsmagical_chromagrams.csv">All Things Magical Chromagram</a></li>
				<li><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Allthingsmagical_coefficients.csv">All Things Magical Coefficients</a></li>
				<li><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Delight_Jazz_chromagram.csv">Delight Chromagram</a></li>
				<li><a href="/MCA/data/Lab_9/Delight_Jazz_coefficients.csv">Delight Coefficients</a></li>

		  <p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 10: Similarity and Transcription</b></p>
		  <p>My visualisation of the similarity matrix created through python, can be seen through the following document: <a href="I:/MCA/data/Lab_10/LAB 10 Python screenshots.docx">Python Screenshots</a></p>
		  <br><p><b>Comparrison of Original VS Transcribed Composition</b><br>
					<p><b>What information has been lost?</b><br>
					In the new composition the Title, Composer, Lyricist as well as the lyrics themselves are all absent from the piece.<br><br>
					<b>Reflect on the accuracy of the transcription.</b><br>
					The new composition appears to be completely all over the place and not at all resembling the original. The time signature has changed from a duple to a triple
					which has resulted in a change in tempo. Additionally the piece has changed from an A major sharp to a F major flat.<br>
					<b>Does removing the "voice" instrument make any difference?</b><br>
					From this I noticed no notable differences.<br><br>
					Overall, the new composition seems to have lost the majority of its' structure and seems to have added bars as it has increased from 102 in the original composition;
					to 135 in the transcribed version. In addition the new composition fails to provide any information regarding what instruments are being used.
					Upon listening to the new track I was able to distinguish the similarities to the original piece however in general it is rather haphazard.
					Furthermore in the original composition when the piece breiefly changes time signature from 2/2 to 1/2. This has been completely in the transcribed version
					as it remains the same signature of 3/4 throughout.</p>
