	  <h2>Project Dataset: Musical Theater</h2>
	  
	  <p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 1: Musical Datasets</b></p>
	  <p style = "font-size:100%;">Current manifestations of this dataset theme include a "Broadway" Genre on Spotify. This contains playlists such as:</p>
	  <ul>
	       <li>Best of Broadway</li>
		   <li>Sucessos da Broadway</li>
		   <li>Hits from Musicals</li>
		   <li>Ballads from Musicals</li>
		   
		</ul>
			<p style = "font-size:100%;">The app also possesses several unofficial playlists made by spotify users</p><br>
			<b><p style = "font-size:120%;">How is the data presented, described and analysed?</p></b>
			<p>The data is presented in a series of playlists, each accompanied by a cover photo as well as the number of followers the playlist has.
			Compared to other genres "Broadway" has significantly less content within it, suggesting a lack of demand.
			Each song that exists within the playlist comes with 'Song Credits' which includes who the song is 'Performed by'; 'Written by'; 'Produced by';
			as well as the 'Source' of the music. <br>
			Spotify presumably produces these genre playlists by analysing each song's accompanying metadata.</p><br>

	<ul>
		
		<li><a href="DROMP1.html">Don't Rain On My Parade (Original Version)</a></li>
		<li><a href="DROMP_GLEE.html">Don't Rain On My Parade (Glee Cast Version) </a></li>

		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 3: Encoding Notated Music</b></p>
		<p style = "font-size:120%;">In week 3, we transformed our MusicXML files into MEI so they could be viewed on the site 'Verovio'. Through the use 
		of  Oxygen we were able to explore each of our MEI files and observe changes in the notated music after the modification of the MEI file.
		In my exploration I changed the octave from a 1 to a 3 and played around with several pitch names. The most obvious change however,
		came after I changed the duration from a 4 to a 3, this resulted in one of the notes being deleted entirely and consequently altered the entire introduction of the piece.
		These changes can be observed in the images below:</p>

		<img src="/MCA/data/Lab_3/DRUMPeditedMEI.png" alt="Edited MEI file presented through Verovio" width="600" height="500"></br>
		<p>The rest of the information and files such as musicxml and mei can be accessed and viewed through data/Lab_3</p>
		
		
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 5: Histogram and Piano Roll Analysis</b></p>
		
		<p style = "font-size:130%;"><b>Don't Rain on My Parade (Original Version)<br><br>Histogram</p></b>
		<img src="/MCA/data/Lab_5_Analysis/DRUMPhistogram.png" alt="Don't Rain on My Parade Histogram" width="504" height="542">

		<br>
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 7: Basic Analytics</b></p>
		<p>In Week 7 I added metadata to both Don't Rain on My Parade files, providing information regarding each piece such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Work Creator e.g. Composer</li>
			<li>Work Lyricist</li>
			<li>Work Performer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to the files being two different versions of the same piece, the only notable difference in the metadata between the two
			was the performer and its origin, notated by the Series Stmt tag.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p style = "font-size:160%;"><b>Week 8: Music as Sound</b></p>
		<p>For Week 8 we downloaded three music tracks of different genres from <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a></p>
		<p>Following this I constructed a table within Excel to showcase the different metadata associate with each track.
		   I later changed copied this table into a word document which contains Waveforms and Spectogram images for each track: <a href="I:/MCA/data/Lab_8/Metadata Table.docx">Metadata Document</a></p>
